# Blackbird
Software Engineering virtual experience program

Here is the background information on your task
In this task, the team will perform a sequence of Git and GitHub actions with the help of GitHub CLI https://github.com/cli/cli

Git is one of the most popular Version Control System (VCS), that is used for tracking changes in any set of files. It is usually used for coordinating work amongst programmers, and collaboratively developing source code during software development.

This Git versioning system is usually complemented by GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service that lets us manage Git repositories, where we can do related things like creating a Pull Request (PR) along with conducting review and merging it.

The sequence of actions performed in this task will be a combination of Git and GitHub actions, from creating a repository on GitHub, pushing codebase from local, branching, and then creating, reviewing, and merging a PR.

In real-world use, this sequence can be put into a shell script (.sh) file to create an automated sequence, performing coordinated Git and GitHub actions.

Here is your task
We've broken down the steps for you in stages below so you can accomplish this task in an organized manner.

Create react app using the create-react-app tool https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#quick-overview
Commit the code, create GitHub repo using GitHub CLI
Switch branch to “update_logo”
Replace existing logo with https://www.propelleraero.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vector.svg
Replace existing link with https://www.propelleraero.com/dirtmate/
Commit, then push the code
Create PR from “update_logo” to “master” branch using GitHub CLI
Merge the PR using GitHub CLI (ideally another engineer has to approve the PR before merging, but we will skip the approval step because we cannot approve our own PR)
List all commands you used in steps 1-8 on “command.sh” file
Add the link of your GitHub repository into the command.sh file # REPO_URL <github_url> (don’t forget to make it public repo).
